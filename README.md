## 🌍 Project Overview

The **Bright Minds Foundation Donation Website** is a responsive, interactive platform created to help collect donations and raise awareness for underprivileged children.  
It provides users with an easy and secure way to contribute towards education, clothing, and food support programs.  

The site includes clearly defined sections for **About Us**, **Donations**, **Our Mission**, **Impact**, **Team**, **Testimonials**, and **Contact**.  
All visuals and animations were built using **HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript**, ensuring smooth user navigation across all devices.

## 📱 Responsiveness Notes

- **Mobile (≤ 550px):**  
  The layout automatically stacks vertically; navigation collapses into a toggle menu.
- **Tablet (551px–991px):**  
  Grid adjusts to two-column layouts; images resize for balance.
- **Desktop (≥ 992px):**  
  All sections display full-width layouts with card hover effects and parallax-inspired padding.
- Media queries ensure consistent spacing and text readability on all screen sizes.

---

## ♿ Accessibility Features

- All important images include **alt-text** for screen readers.
- **Keyboard-friendly navigation** — links and buttons are tabbable.  
- **Color contrast** meets accessibility standards (dark navy and white palette).  
- Smooth scroll behavior assists users with motor impairments.  
- Includes **ARIA-compliant semantic structure** (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`).
